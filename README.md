### About
This is the ***Simple Tic-Tac-Toe*** project I made myself while studying at [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org)
<p>Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Letâ€™s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!</p>
This project is a part of the following tracks:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/18">Kotlin Core</a></li>
